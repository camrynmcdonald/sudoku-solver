# sudoku-solver

This repository contains a project that implements an algorithm to solve a sudoku board and creates a visual representation of the board being solved.

## Descrpition

Create a sudoku solver using:

- object oriented programming
- node-based stack
- two-dimensional array

## Technologies

Project created with:
* Java version 16.0.2

## Executing Program

- Run the Sudoku class to solve a sudoku board with your choice of the starting number of initial values in the board as a command line argument
- To solve multiple boards and see the percentage that are solvable, run the AutoSimulation class, which requires two command line arguemnts: desired number of simulations first and then desired number of initial values in the board
